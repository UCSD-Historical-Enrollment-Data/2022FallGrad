# Fall 2022 Enrollment Data: Graduate Courses
Enrollment data for some graduate courses in Fall 2022 at UC San Diego.

I will start uploading data on **May 20, 2022**.

## Supported Courses
| Course Level                   | Courses to be Tracked                               | Amount |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 200-297 (Graduate)             | Courses in the CSE, ECE, MATH, and COGS department. | 102    |

Number of courses accurate as of May 17, 2022.

## Intervals
Note that all data here is gathered along with all undergraduate course data.

There is a 0.5 second delay between requests (note that this delay is *significantly* lower compared to the previous times I've been doing this, and may be adjusted).

Thus, expect one full cycle (i.e., 1148 requests) to be completed in **574** seconds, or approximately a 10 minute interval between requests to the *same* course.

## Notices
I do not have data for May 25, 2022, from approximately 4:20 AM to approximately 11:00 AM Pacific Time. The cause of this is due my login script encountering a fatal error when trying to log back into WebReg.
